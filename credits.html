        <h3>Using Jekyll</h3>
        <p>Jekyll is an Open-Source static site generator by GitHub. Jekyll provided many features which helped us
            to modularize the website such as a looping
            facility which we could use to render common HTML through a loop rather than copying it out many times.
            This was especially useful in the Meet the team page as it allowed us to write a single div which
            contained the semantics for each team member then have the generator generate the page using content
            provided in markdown files. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>SASS and LineageOS</h3>
        <p>We decided to use SASS over CSS. SASS is built upon CSS but also adds
            useful tools such as variables to hold common values such as brand colors and fonts etc. The SASS that
            has been implemented was adapted from the Open-Source LineageOS website found
            <a href="https://github.com/lineageos/www" target="_blank">here</a>.These SASS components were adapted by
            LineageOS from the Bootstrap
            Framework and Material Kit, all of which are licensed under the permissive MIT license.

            Also, from the LineageOS website, we adapted their blog page, 404 Page and we have also adapted
            some of their layouts for other pages in our website as we found it to meet our aesthetic requirements
            and it also provided an efficient way to write blog posts.

                Mirror was used to implement multiplayer use Mirror. This is an Open-Source implementation of Unityâ€™s now
                deprecated UNet library. This library was pre-tested, scalable, had a strong community backing and
                already had the strong Unity integration that PlayerLink lacked. We then spent the final week of the MVP
                stage working to port our game to Mirror.
